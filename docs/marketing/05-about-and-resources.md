## Company Story

### Headline
**"Built by a Security Engineer Who Got Tired of Begging"**

### The Story

> "After years working as a security engineer, I saw the same problem everywhere: security teams were treated as second-class citizens. We didn't have access to the information we needed to do our jobs. We begged developers for tech stacks. We maintained spreadsheets of applications. We had no idea what was actually in production.
>
> But it wasn't just a security problem. Developers were frustrated too—constantly interrupted to answer the same questions. Product teams had no visibility. Everyone was working in silos.
>
> Stagehand is the solution I wished existed. A single platform where everyone—security, development, product—can access the same accurate information. No more silos. No more second-class treatment. Just better collaboration and better security."

### The Problem We Solve

#### The Security Engineer's Dilemma
- **No visibility** into what applications exist
- **No access** to tech stacks and dependencies
- **No ownership** information for critical systems
- **Scattered data** across multiple tools and spreadsheets
- **Treated as second-class citizens** in the organization

#### The Developer's Burden
- **Constant interruptions** from security and compliance teams
- **Duplicate documentation** in multiple places
- **Maintenance overhead** keeping everything in sync
- **Being the bottleneck** for other teams' information needs

#### The Leadership's Blind Spots
- **No portfolio visibility** across the organization
- **No security posture** understanding
- **No resource allocation** insights
- **Making decisions** without complete data

### Our Solution

#### The Philosophy
**"Collaboration over features. Quality over complexity."**

We don't try to be everything to everyone. Instead, we focus on the essential features that serve ALL teams:

- **Application catalog** that developers can maintain and security can trust
- **Security findings** that are accessible to everyone, not just security teams
- **Product inventory** that gives leadership the visibility they need

#### The Approach
1. **Built by security, for everyone** - Designed with the access problems in mind
2. **Shared context, not silos** - Everyone works from the same data
3. **Quality over complexity** - Simple, powerful features instead of bloated tooling
4. **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box, no YAML hell

## Mission & Vision

### Mission
**"Break down the silos between security, development, and product teams"**

### Vision
**"A world where everyone building software has complete visibility"**

### Values

#### Empathy
We understand the pain because we've lived it. Every feature is designed with real user problems in mind.

#### Simplicity
Complex problems deserve simple solutions. We choose clarity over cleverness.

#### Collaboration
We believe better software comes from better collaboration between teams.

#### Quality
We'd rather do a few things really well than many things poorly.
