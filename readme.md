# Campground

### Ship Your SaaS, Not Your Scaffolding

Campground is a production-ready, open-source boilerplate for building scalable, multi-tenant web applications. It comes with a complete, modern tech stack and pre-built features like a flexible hierarchy, role-based permissions, and user authentication, so you can focus on building what matters most: your product.

This project is designed to give you a massive head start when developing a SaaS application that requires sophisticated tenancy and permission models.

This project was built largely with cursor on Gemini 2.5 Pro model and mostly monitored, refactored and approved by a senior level developer. There are some definite pieces of bad code in here, however everything seems to be functioning as expected.

## Core Features

Campground provides a robust foundation with all the essential features needed for a modern multi-tenant application.

*   **Flexible Multi-Tenant Hierarchies:**
    *   Model complex organizational structures right out of the box: **Organizations → Companies → Teams → Projects**.
    *   The hierarchy is fully customizable, allowing you to rename levels to fit your specific domain needs (e.g., "Schools" instead of "Companies").
    *   The top-level "Organization" can be toggled on or off depending on your business requirements.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   A granular permission system is built-in with default roles: **Admin**, **Editor**, and **Reader**.
    *   Permissions are hierarchical, meaning roles at a higher level (like a Company) grant access to all nested resources (like Teams and Projects within it).
    *   A secure middleware layer on the backend enforces all permission checks for every API request.

*   **User Authentication & Onboarding:**
    *   **Secure Authentication:** Features a complete, session-based authentication system.
    *   **Invite System:** Effortlessly onboard new users with invite links. Invitations can pre-configure a user's role and access level before they even sign up.
    *   **Automatic Domain Join:** Automatically assign new users to the correct Organization or Company based on their email domain, with built-in DNS verification for security.
    *   **OIDC & SSO:** Allow organizations to integrate with their own identity providers (like Okta, Azure AD) for seamless and secure single sign-on.

*   **Ready-to-Deploy:**
    *   The entire application is containerized with Docker.
    *   Get a full development environment running locally—including the database—with a single command: `docker-compose up`.

## Coming Soon Features

 **Email Capabilities:** Email notifications and other transaction email needs
 
 **User Notification System:** A general user notification system
