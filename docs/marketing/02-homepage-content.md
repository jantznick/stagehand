## Problem Statement Section

### Headline
**"Your Teams Are Working Blind"**

### Three-Column Layout

#### Column 1: Security Teams
**"Security teams can't find what needs securing"**

- "Which apps use Log4j?" ‚Üí 3 days of Slack messages
- Findings scattered across 5 different tools
- No visibility into tech stacks or ownership
- Treated as second-class citizens

#### Column 2: Development Teams
**"Development teams are documentation sources, not builders"**

- Constantly interrupted for "what version of X?"
- Same info lives in Confluence, Jira, and spreadsheets
- Maintaining docs in 5 different places
- Being the bottleneck for other teams

#### Column 3: Product Teams
**"Product teams have no portfolio visibility"**

- Can't answer "what are all our customer-facing apps?"
- No central owner/contact information
- No visibility into security posture
- Making decisions in the dark

## Additional Sections (Optional)

### FAQ Section
**"Frequently Asked Questions"**

**Q: How is this different from Backstage?**
A: Backstage is a framework requiring extensive YAML configuration. Stagehand is a product that works out of the box and includes security findings‚Äîserving your entire organization, not just developers.

**Q: What about our existing security tools?**
A: Stagehand integrates with your existing tools (Snyk, GitHub, etc.) rather than replacing them. We aggregate and normalize the data so everyone can see it in one place.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Most teams are up and running in a few hours. Connect your tools, define your structure, invite your teams, and start collaborating.

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Yes. We use enterprise-grade security practices, support SSO/OIDC, and offer on-premise deployment options for sensitive environments.
