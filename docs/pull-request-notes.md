# PR Notes: Feature - Comprehensive Security Findings

This pull request introduces a comprehensive security findings management system into Stagehand, transforming it into a foundational Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) tool. It includes backend infrastructure for multiple security tool integrations, a manual finding creation workflow, and the frontend components to support these features.

## Summary of Changes

### Core Features Implemented
- **Traceable Security Integration**: Added full backend support for integrating Traceable API Security. This includes API client, data synchronization logic, and project linking capabilities.
- **Manual Finding Creation**: Users with appropriate permissions can now manually add security findings to any project. This is crucial for tracking issues found during penetration tests, manual code reviews, or from tools not yet integrated.
- **External Vulnerability Enrichment**: A new service (`vulnerabilityLookup.js`) automatically enriches findings that have a CVE identifier by fetching detailed, standardized information from public databases like the NVD. This service includes rate limiting and fallback mechanisms.
- **Unified Data Model**: The Prisma schema has been updated to support a normalized `Vulnerability` and `Finding` model. This model uses a compound key (`vulnerabilityId`, `source`) to correctly store and attribute findings from different tools to the same underlying vulnerability (e.g., a single CVE reported by both Snyk and Traceable).

### Backend
- **New Routes**:
  - `packages/api/src/routes/securityTools.js`: Extended to support Traceable, adding endpoints to list services (`/traceable/services`) and trigger syncs.
  - `packages/api/src/routes/vulnerabilities.js`: New routes to search the local vulnerability database and to perform external lookups (`/external/:cveId`).
  - `packages/api/src/routes/findings.js`: New routes to list all findings for a project and to create new manual findings.
- **New Utilities**:
  - `packages/api/src/utils/traceable.js`: A dedicated client for interacting with the Traceable GraphQL API.
  - `packages/api/src/utils/findings.js`: Extended with `syncTraceableFindings` to handle the asynchronous data pull from Traceable.
  - `packages/api/src/utils/vulnerabilityLookup.js`: A robust service for fetching data from external vulnerability databases.
- **Configuration**:
  - `packages/api/src/config/vulnerability-apis.js`: Centralized configuration for external APIs, including URLs and rate limits.
- **Dependencies**: Removed `node-fetch` in favor of the native `fetch` API available in modern Node.js versions, adhering to our principle of minimizing dependencies.

### Frontend
- **State Management (Zustand)**:
  - `packages/web/src/stores/useFindingStore.js`: A new store to manage state for fetching findings, searching vulnerabilities, and creating manual findings.
- **React Components**:
  - `packages/web/src/components/findings/FindingList.jsx`: Displays all findings for a project in a table and includes the "Add Finding" button.
  - `packages/web/src/components/findings/AddFindingModal.jsx`: A modal form for creating a new manual finding.
  - `packages/web/src/components/findings/VulnerabilitySearch.jsx`: A reusable component within the modal for searching local vulnerabilities or looking up external CVEs.
- **Hooks**:
  - `packages/web/src/hooks/useDebounce.js`: A simple, reusable hook to debounce user input in the search component, optimizing performance.

### Database
- **`prisma.schema`**:
  - The `Vulnerability` model now includes a `source` field and a compound unique key `@@unique([vulnerabilityId, source])`.
  - The `Finding` model was updated to relate to the `Vulnerability` model using this new compound key.

This foundational work enables Stagehand to ingest, normalize, and display security data from a variety of sources, providing users with a centralized view of their application security posture.
