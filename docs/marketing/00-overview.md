## Executive Summary

### What is Stagehand?

Stagehand is **the unified platform that breaks down silos** between development, security, and product teams by providing a single source of truth for application metadata, security findings, and product catalog information.

### The Core Insight

**Teams don't need MORE features—they need the RIGHT features that work for EVERYONE.**

Existing tools optimize for a single team, creating information silos:
- **Backstage:** 1000 features for developers, zero for security
- **ASPM tools:** Deep security analysis, but developers can't use it
- **CMDBs:** IT operations focus, no one else can navigate it

**Stagehand's approach:** A focused set of high-quality features that serve ALL teams.

### Target Market

**Primary:** Mid-to-large enterprises (200+ employees) with:
- Established development teams
- Security/AppSec functions
- Quality data and processes to leverage
- Multiple applications to manage

**Business Model:** Closed-source SaaS with a free tier

### Positioning Statement

"Stagehand is the unified platform for application intelligence. Unlike Backstage (developer-only), ASPM tools (security-only), or CMDBs (operations-only), Stagehand provides a shared source of truth that serves your entire organization."

## Key Differentiators

1. **Collaboration over features** - The right features that work for everyone, not everything for one team
2. **Built by security, for everyone** - Designed with the access problems in mind
3. **Shared context, not silos** - Everyone sees the same data, reducing duplicate work
4. **Quality over complexity** - Simple, powerful features instead of bloated tooling
5. **Zero YAML configuration** - Unlike Backstage, it's a real product not a framework
